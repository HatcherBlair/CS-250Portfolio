# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
The best way to interpret a users needs is to put them into a user story.  A user story is a simplified version of their request that gives the developer working on the reqest a break down of what the feature needs to do and how it should act.  It also gives the developer a reason behind the feature request which is helpful for them to see where the application or website failed and why it should be improved.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorperate into my future development work?
When first starting a project I spend a lot of time in the planning and research phase.  This is important because you need to identify any potential roadblocks before they are holding back the project and you need to have an understanding of the requirements of the project befor you can start work.  I am a big fan of the Scum agile model and I hope to incorperate more of the scrum methodology to my future work.  I like the daily scrum most because it encourages open communication between all of the team members and helps find solutions to issues that the team has encountered.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member will fulfill all of their roles duties on a day to day basis.  They will also be self organizing and need little input from others in organizing their daily work load.  They are punctual and show up to all their meetings on time and prepared to talk.  They are also willing to help others with their struggles and help grow the whole team together.
